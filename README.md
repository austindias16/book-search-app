- How long did you spend on the coding assignment?

  > I spent around 8 hours for this assignment. This included the following tasks:
  > -- UI creation
  > -- Theme creation and styling
  > -- API service integration & Data modeling for UI

- a. What would you add to your solution if you had more time?
- b. If you didn&#39;t spend much time on the coding test, then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
> With better UX, design and more time, I would have added more UI indicators like spinners, missing image placeholders, a different route to display a detailed description of each book title.

- What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen
  language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you&#39;ve used it.
  > There are a lot of new features in the new version of React like Concurrency. But since the question is about what is being used in the app, I would speak of hooks. Hooks are not exactly new but are very useful. Because of the introduction of hooks, state can be used in functional components which was not the case in the past.
- How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
  > Use generated reports from lighthouse, React Profiler, check Network latencies, reduce number of API calls and use caching for data that does not change very often
- How would you improve the API that you just used?
  > values in the API response body are not uniform. Book title published date have improper dates while some have only year, Book title image URLs for the cover are blank.
- Please describe yourself using correctly formatted JSON.
